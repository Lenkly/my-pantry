# What's in my pantry?!

baby steps in the Vue-CLI 🙇‍♀️

What I'm trying to build here: a collaborative app for our pantry management, that lets every unique user add, update and remove items from the virtual pantry.

Nice to have features:

- a colored indicator to show what's in, low in or out of stock
- a search function with filters for categories or brand names
- tbc
